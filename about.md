I'm a technical marketer with a focus on data, analytics, and marketing-focused business operations.

I've been a people manager, a global product manager, a head of marketing, a medical device startup founder, and I'm currently refining my skillset - focusing on data analysis using Python, and web data visualization using Javascript and d3.

And I'm also one of the creators and hosts of the [You Suck at Marketing](http://www.badmarketingmedia.com) Podcast.
