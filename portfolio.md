This program queries the US Geological Survey for a GeoJson of all earthquakes in the past 7 days. Using JavaScript and Leaflet, each earthquakes is then mapped with the color and size of each circle relative to the magnitude of the earthquake. A user can also select to display lines of tectonic plates, and each earthquake circle is clickable which will display additional information.
